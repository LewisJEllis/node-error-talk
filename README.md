# Robust Error Handling in Node.js
This is a ~45 minute tech talk on achieving robust error handling in Node.js applications.

I have given forms of this talk at:
- [SFNode Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sfnode/), March 2017
  - [Video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G3C8Y5tzw4)
  - [SpeakerDeck Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lewisjellis/robust-error-handling-in-node-v1)
- [South Bay JS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/southbayjs/events/242432304/), September 2017
- [Connect.Tech](http://connect.tech/), September 2017
  - [SpeakerDeck Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lewisjellis/robust-error-handling-in-node-dot-js)

I made these slides with [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/). This repository contains the markdown and other components used, and a PDF export for easy viewing.

Abstract:
> Unlike other platforms, error handling in Node.js is not as simple as try/catch.
> 
> It can be a handful between exceptions, callbacks, promises, event emitters, and other library patterns.
> 
> In this talk, learn to navigate the different error handling mechanisms and build robust Node applications so that when unhandled errors do happen, we can fail gracefully, alert someone, and minimize downtime.
