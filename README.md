# Robust Error Handling in Node
This is a ~30-40 minute tech talk on robust error handling in Node applications.

I gave this talk at the March 2017 [SFNode Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sfnode/). The slides are on Speaker Deck [here](https://speakerdeck.com/lewisjellis/robust-error-handling-in-node), and there was also a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G3C8Y5tzw4).

I made these slides with [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/). This repository contains the markdown and other components used, and a PDF export for easy viewing.

Abstract:
> Unlike other platforms, error handling in Node.js is not as simple as try/catch.
> 
> It can be a handful between exceptions, callbacks, promises, event emitters, and other library patterns.
> 
> In this talk, learn to navigate the different error handling mechanisms and build robust Node applications so that when unhandled errors do happen, we can fail gracefully, alert someone, and minimize downtime."
